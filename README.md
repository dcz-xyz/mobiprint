# MobiPrint: A Mobile 3D Printer for Environment-Scale Design and Fabrication


Abstract: 3D printing is transforming our ability to customize and create physical objects for varying applications in engineering, accessibility, and art. However, this technology is still limited to confined working areas and dedicated print beds, thereby detaching design and fabrication from real-world environments. In this paper, we present MobiPrint, a prototype mobile fabrication system that combines elements from robotics, architecture, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to enable environment-scale design and fabrication in ad-hoc indoor environments. MobiPrint consists of a robotic 3D printer and an accompanying design tool that maps an indoor space and converts into a canvas for users to modify and arrange objects to be printed directly onto the ground. We provide a walkthrough of our environment-scale fabrication process including mapping, model selection and editing, and autonomous printing on ground surfaces. Through a "proof-by-demonstration" validation, we highlight our system's potential across different applications, e.g. accessibility, home furnishing, and floor signage. We also conduct a technical evaluation to assess MobiPrints's location accuracy, payload capacity, and mapping speed and discuss how our prototype could inform future work in mobile fabrication that aims to integrate custom 3D designs into real-world settings.
